### Additional installation steps

- You **have to** define `DMOJ_PROBLEM_DATA_ROOT` in `local_settings.py`, which should be the path to the directory that contains your problems' tests.

- Regarding disabling full-text search, please read [this issue](https://github.com/VNOI-Admin/OJ/issues/4) for more information.

- To sync the judge server and the site's cache, change the cache framework (`CACHES`) to `memcached` or `redis` instead of the default (local-memory caching).

- If you use `python3 manage.py loaddata demo`, the home button in the admin dashboard (/admin) links you to `localhost:8081`, there are 2 ways to change that:

  1. You can change that in [demo.json](/judge/fixtures/demo.json)
  2. You can go to the admin page, scroll down to find the `Sites` setting and change `localhost:8081` to your domain.

- To support `testlib.h`, you need to copy [testlib.h](https://github.com/MikeMirzayanov/testlib/blob/master/testlib.h) to `g++`'s include path in the judge server. To speed up compile time, you can also create a precompiled header for `testlib.h`.
